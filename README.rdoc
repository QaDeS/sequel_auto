== Sequel Auto

This plug-in makes defining your models for accessing a database as easy as:

  Sequel::Model.plugin :auto
  Sequel::Model.auto_models

You can also use the automatic retrieval of associations when you are defining
your models by hand:

  Sequel::Model.plugin :auto

  class Foo < Sequel::Model
    auto_assoc

    ...
  end

This plugin currently works for PostgreSQL only!
More databases will be supported soon.
